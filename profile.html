        <h3>A little about me</h3>
        <p>I really do like a lot of things, but my life overall is
            quite simple. I go with the flow. Sit in a tub and just vibe.
            I usually create quite the atmosphere, people just like to be around
            me. Mostly kids, I'm the most popular during any sort of water activity,
            always being invited to a swim.
        </p>

            <h6> More About The Dev</h6>

        </div>
        <p class="sad-dev-story">TJ is a deadend developer who makes pointless websites for rubber ducks
            nobody knows exactly why he does it. But they theorize that it brings him
            satasfaction knowing that at least 3 people will see his website about rubber ducks,
            and perhaps those 3 individuals might buy a rubber duck, and that in turn might help
            reduce the risk of rubber duck extinction from our society.
